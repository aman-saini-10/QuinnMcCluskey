# QuinnMcCluskey Logic Minimizer
## C++ code for simulating the Quinn McCluskey process of logic minimization
The code requires an `output.txt` file in the same directory as the code to print the results of the process


### THIS PROGRAM HAS FOLLOWING FEATURES:

#### > * PRINTS THE TABLE CONSTRUCTED DURING THE SIMULATION OF QM ALGORITHM (FOR TROUBLE-SHOOTING AND UNDERSTANDING THE PROCEDURE)
#### > * PRINTS THE ESSENTIAL PRIME IMPLICANTS
#### > * PRINTS THE NON-ESSENTIAL PRIME IMPLICANTS
#### > * PRINTS THE FINAL EXPRESSION

### THE PROGRAM ACCECPTS INPUTS IN TERMS OF 2 VECTOR (minterms and dontcare) AND A NUMBER (num).
#### > * VECTOR minterms should contain the minterms associated with the boolean
#### > * VECTOR dontcare should contain the dont care conditions associated with the boolean function
#### > * INTEGER num DENOTES THE N0. OF TERMS
